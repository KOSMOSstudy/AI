## AI

This repository is for AI study group that three universities(
Kwangwoon, Myongji, Sungshin) attend in until 2021.09 to 2022.03. It is all about the basic concept of AI and our curriculum is composed of two big parts.

### Contents

- Study with E-Book
- Study with cs231n

The E-Book consists of 5 parts.  
To understanding the follwing lecture correctly, python skill is required.

1. Linear Regression
2. Logistic Regression
3. Softmax Regression
4. Artificial Neural Network
5. Convolutional Nerual Network

On the other hand, the cs231n consists of 12 Lectures.

1. Lecture 1: Introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition
2. Lecture 2:Image Classification
3. Lecture 3:Loss Functions and Optimization
4. Lecture 4:Introduction to Neural Networks
5. Lecture 5:Convolutional Neural Network
6. Lecture 6:Training Neural Networks I
7. Lecture 7:Training Neural Networks II
8. Lecture 8:Deep Learning Software
9. Lecture 9:CNN Architectures
10. Lecture 10:Recurrent Neural Network
11. Lecture 11:Detection and Segmentation
12. Lecture 12:Visualizing and Understanding

When we held a study meeting, we didn't do presentation with ppt but did Q&A(A Study leader gave an answer about the questions of group members). Therefore, there isn't any resource for cs231n. And also, because of clarity, we didn't upload the cs231n lectures.
